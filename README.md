# coil_winder

MPLAB project

The circuit consists of 
1x PIC18F2550 microcontroller, 
2x L293D motor drivers, 
1x MAX232 serial port chip, 
2x nema 17 stepper motors

One motor is winding the coil while the other one is moving a guider forth and back along the width of the core
to aid laying the wire side by side on the core.

The microcontroller receives the coil parameters on serial port connection from a windows program 
that provides the user interface for the circuit.
That windows program will also be shared here.

Circuit diagram will be added later.
