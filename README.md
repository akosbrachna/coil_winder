# coil_winder

MPLAB project

The circuit consists of 
1x PIC18F2550 microcontroller, 
2x L293D motor drivers, 
1x MAX232 serial port chip, 
2x nema 17 stepper motors

Circuit diagram will be added later.
A windows program that provides the user interface for the circuit is also developed.
That program will also be shared here.
