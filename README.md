# coil_winder

MPLAB project

The circuit consists of 

1x PIC18F2550 microcontroller, 

2x L293D motor drivers, 

1x MAX232 serial port chip, 

2x nema 17 stepper motors

One motor is winding the coil while the other one is moving a guider forth and back along the width of the core
to aid laying the wire side by side on the core.

The microcontroller receives the coil parameters on serial port from a windows program 
that provides the user interface for the circuit. https://github.com/akosbrachna/coil_winder_interface

Future plan is to add a current sensor resistor on the high voltage input that will be connected to the analog comparator 
of the microcontroller. The microcontroller through a power transistor would limit the input current on the drivers
if the current exceeds the specified current of the drivers.
